                In this new era of advancements and striding researches in new
                directions of engineering sciences, the traditional engineering
                syllabus and academic training is inadequate. The gap between an
                student and industry ready graduate has been increasing and acan
                be decreased by exposure and self initiated project works
                involving creative inputs as well as constantly learning new
                skills and tools which are close to the industrial standards.
